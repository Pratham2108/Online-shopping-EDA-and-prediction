# Online-shopping-EDA-and-prediction

Dataset: 'Final Dataset.csv'
Code: 'Online shopping EDA+RandomForestRegressor.ipynb'

It is a simple python code which can be run on any Python IDE.

This is the first full-fledged DS project made from scratch, although very basic but am proud of.
This project was created for the preliminary selection round in the process of applying internship at MissionED. 
First, I used Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn and Matplotlib for exploring understanding and visualising the data. 
Then the Sklearn library was used for encoding categorical data after which training on the data using Random-Forest Regressor algorithm was made in order to make
predictions on what product a customer may buy.
